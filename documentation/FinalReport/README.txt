README
======

These document templates are provided as examples that
you could use to start your Final Report for the
Major/Minor Project (MMP). You are not required to use these 
templates, but they might be a useful starting point. 

You can modify the structure of the document, but it is suggested that 
unless you have a good reason, the order and titles of the main sections should be kept. 

Word Templates / Open Office Templates
The Word and Open Office Templates are provided as template files. Double click to 
open in Word / Open Office. This will create a new unnamed document based on this
template. There are some example chapters and sections. 

Track changes are currently on, showing some points to change on the first few pages. Please turn them off before printing a final copy - we don't want to see these comments in your submitted report :-) 

LaTeX Template 
A style file, mmp.sty contains the main formatting information. The 
document dissertation.tex shows an example
of how to use the template. The dissertation.tex file defines the main content and 
includes several files.  You can edit the cover.tex file to modify the 
items that appear on the front page. 

The example also shows the use of a BibTeX file and how to include it 
and make references. 

If you have any questions about the report, please get in touch.
